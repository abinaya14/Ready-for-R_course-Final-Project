# Ready-for-R : Final Project
This repository contains the final project that I developed as part of the Ready for R course (BMI 507, Oregon Health &amp; Science University) using the Tidyverse package in R 

# Research Question: 
The dataset that I have chosen has employment and salary information of men and women across multiple job sectors over many years. Dataset source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday. I am interested to find out whether gender-pay gap still exists (as of 2016). If yes, how does this compare to previous years (ex: 2013) and which job category has the highest disparity.

# Expectation about the data prior to analysis: 
I am expecting to see less gender-pay gap disparity in 2016 compared to 2013. With respect to job sector, I think some sectors such as service will have more disparity when compared to sectors such as management and healthcare. 

# Final Summary post data analysis:

My question was to find out whether gender pay-gap existed in 2016, and if yes, how does it compare to 2013 and which job-sector had the highest pay-gap in 2016 vs 2013. My analysis above shows that gender pay-gap did exist as of 2016 and 2013 across all job sectors, where men were consistenly paid higher than women. When compared to 2013, the difference in yearly salaries between men and women in 2016 was very similar for two job-sectors - namely tech (computer, engineering and science) and service industries.For all other job sectors the difference in yearly salaries between men and women had increased in 2016 compared to 2013.

These findings were not what I initially expected. My expectations were that the gender pay-gap would not have existed in all job sectors in 2016. Even if they did, I was not expecting the salary differences between men and women to be even higher than previous years (2013). What I did not take into consideration is the number of women and men actively working in each of these job-sectors and their occupation. This pay-gap maybe due to fewer women in the work-force in general or because of disparities in the kinds of jobs performed by men and women within the same job-sector.
