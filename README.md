# Ready-for-R_course-Final-Project
This repository contains the final project that I developed as part of the Ready for R course (BMI 507, Oregon Health &amp; Science University) using the Tidyverse package in R 

# Research Question: 
The dataset that I have chosen has employment and salary information of men and women across multiple job sectors over many years. Dataset source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday. I am interested to find out whether gender-pay gap still exists (as of 2016). If yes, how does this compare to previous years (ex: 2013) and which job category has the highest disparity.

# Expectation about the data prior to analysis: 
I am expecting to see less gender-pay gap disparity in 2016 compared to 2013. With respect to job sector, I think some sectors such as service will have more disparity when compared to sectors such as management and healthcare.
